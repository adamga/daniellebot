# daniellebot

This repository now contains a Node.js web application designed as a chatbot. The chatbot features include an input area for user queries and a response area that supports scrolling to display both inputs and responses dynamically. Additionally, the project incorporates a server-side API developed in C# and .NET Core 8, which handles chat requests and interactions.

Furthermore, the repository is equipped with a Terraform project aimed at deploying the necessary infrastructure on Azure. This includes an Azure App Service for hosting the server API, a CosmosDB instance for storing chat history, and an Azure Key Vault for managing secrets securely.
